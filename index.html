        <p>At George Mason High School, we have a outstanding tech program including a strong TSA chapter.</p>
        <p>Our school holds many tech education opportunities, and you can see it just by looking. In our school, every student has a school-issued MacBook Air, which they use in all of their classes and can take home to work on homework or projects. Our school also has several acedemic technology opportunities, Some of these are our high-end Makerspace, our popular Robotics club, and our Cyberpatriots club.</p>
        <h4>Makerspace</h4>
        <p>Over the summer of 2015, our school obtained several grants from *INSERT COMPANY NAME*, and was able to begin construction of a high-powered Makerspace where students may work on any and all projects, from art to musical recording to building robots. Some of our members used it during this year's TSA preparation to build the strap-on shoe wheels which we entered in the Inventions and Innovations competition. **Clarification needed!!!</p>
        <h4>Techspace</h4>
        <p>Several years ago, our school's tech department converted an old snack bar into a tech-support kiosk which students are allowed to operate. Those running the kiosk help other students with their MacBook Airs. Students are allowed to seek help or run the Techspace during Mustang Block (the school-wide free period), or during their own open blocks.</p>
        <h4>Robotics Club</h4>
        <p>Our school has a prominent Robotics club, Vae Victis (Team 1418), which meets frequently during the build season to build a powerful machine to compete in the <a href="http://www.first.org/">FIRST Robotics</a> competition.</p>
        <h4>CyberPatriots</h4>
        <p>At our school, we also have a CyberPatriots chapter. CyberPatriots is a club where students can learn the ins and outs of software and how to use their hacking skills ethically.</p>
