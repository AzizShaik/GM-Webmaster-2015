        <p>In the Falls Church City Public Schools, we have chapters at both our High School, George Mason, and at its counterpart, Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School. While these chapters' teams do not mix as dictated by the rules of the Technology Student Association, we collaborate on numerous parts of the TSA experience.
